Rules
    -> American Checkers is played on a 8x8 board, world Checkers on a 10x10 board
        other countries have different size boards.
    -> Game is played between two opponents on opposite sides of the gamee board.
        usually black v. white or black v. red
    -> Players alternate turns, A player cannot move an opponents pieces.
        a move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square.
    -> Move Rules
        -> If the adjacent square contains an opponents piece, and the square immediately beyond is is vacant,
            the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it
        -> Only the dark squares of the checkerboard are used. A piece can only move diagonally into an unoccupied square.
            When capturing an opponent's piece is possible, capturing is mandatory in most offcial rules.
        -> If the player does not capture, the other player can remove the opponent's piece as a penalty (or muffin)
            where there are two or more such positions the player forfeits pieces that cannot be moved
    -> Win Condition        
        -> The player with no remaining pieces or who cannot move due to being blocked, has lost the game

    
Pieces
    -> Man:
        -> An uncrowned piece (man) moves one step diagonally forwards and captures an adjacent opponents piece by jumping over it and landing on the next square.
        -> Multiple enemy pieces can be captured in a single turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece,
            the jumps do not need to be in the same line and may "zigzag"
        -> In american checkers, men can jump only forwards, in international checkers men can jump both forwards and backwards.
    -> King:
        -> When a man reaches the fathest row forward, known as the kings row or crown head, it becomes a king. Similiar to queening a pawn.
            This is marked by placing an additional piece on top of, or crowning, the first man. The king has additional powers,
            including the ability to move backwards and , in variations where men cannot already do so, capture backwards.
        -> A king, like a man, can make successive jumps in a single turn, provided that each jump captures an enemy piece.
        -> In international checkers(draughts), kings also called flying kings move any distance along unblocked diagonals.
            They may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it. 
            Because jumped pieces remain on the board until the turn is complete, it is possible to reach a position in a multi-jump move where the flying king is blocked from capturing further by a piece already jumped.

    -> Flying kings are not used in American checkers; a king's only advantage over a man is the additional ability to move and capture backwards.
